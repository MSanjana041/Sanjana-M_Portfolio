        <p>
          I’m a third-year B.Tech CSE student interested in front-end development and
          machine learning. I enjoy building things that combine logic and design,
          whether it’s running ML models, experimenting with UI ideas, or trying to
          get through LeetCode.
        </p>

          Right now, I’m learning about social networks and how they work under the hood.
          I’m detail-oriented, drawn to clean design, and I like understanding how things
          fit together. I also enjoy picking up new tools—usually by watching a ridiculous
          number of YouTube tutorials until everything finally clicks.
